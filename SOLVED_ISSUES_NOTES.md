## 🛠 Solved Issues Log

### 1. Gradle Sync Kotlin DSL Failure
* **Symptoms:**
  * `e: file:///.../build.gradle.kts:31:39: Unresolved reference: util`
  * `e: file:///.../build.gradle.kts:34:33: Overload resolution ambiguity: File(...)`
* **Root Cause:**
  * In Gradle's Kotlin DSL (`android { ... }` block), `java` refers to the `JavaPluginExtension`, not the Java core package. Writing `java.util.Properties()` caused Gradle to look for `.util` on the Gradle extension.
  * `properties.getProperty(...)` returns a platform type `String!`, which led Kotlin to report ambiguity between `File(String)` and `File(URI)`.
* **Resolution:**
  * Added explicit standard imports at the top of `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:
    ```kotlin
    import java.io.File
    import java.util.Properties
    ```
  * Initialized `Properties()` directly without namespace collision.
  * Explicitly typed `storeFilePath: String` and resolved files cleanly via `rootProject.file(...)`.

### 2. Android Back Button Closing App During Article Reading & Losing Page Index
* **Symptoms:**
  * When reading an article, pressing the Android back button or predictive back gesture closed the app instead of navigating back to the home feed.
  * When navigating back to Home, the page index was lost (reset to page 1 instead of staying on page 2, 3, etc.).
* **Root Cause:**
  * `MainActivity.kt` did not register an `OnBackPressedCallback` with `onBackPressedDispatcher`. Under Android 13+ (API 33+), unhandled back gestures invoke default system `finish()`.
  * `AndroidBackGestureHandler.tsx` did not handle `/post/...` routes specifically or preserve URL search parameters (`?page=...&category=...`).
* **Resolution:**
  * **Native Android (`MainActivity.kt`):** Added `setupNativeBackGestureHandler()` using AndroidX `OnBackPressedCallback` hooked to `onBackPressedDispatcher`. It delegates to `window.__handleAndroidBackButton()` in the webview.
  * **Unified In-App Handler (`AndroidBackGestureHandler.tsx`):**
    * When on an article (`/post/...`), pressing back navigates to Home with the exact same category and page index (`?page=X`) and restores the reading scroll position.
    * Never closes the app from an article view.
    * On the Home feed (`/`), single back press shows a subtle toast ("Press back again to exit Current News"), and double back press within 2.5s exits the app.
  * **Page Index Cache (`BlogPostCard.tsx` & `HomeView.tsx`):** Cached `current_news_return_search`, `current_news_return_page`, and `current_news_return_scroll` into `sessionStorage` so returning to Home preserves the exact pagination state and scroll position.

### 3. Google Sign-In Opening Webview/Popup with Password Prompt vs. Native Device Account Picker
* **Symptoms:**
  * When signing in on Android, the app opened a web browser/popup asking the user to manually type their Gmail and password, often resulting in `Firebase: Error (auth/cancelled-popup-request)`.
* **Root Cause:**
  * The app was using Firebase Web's `signInWithPopup`, which creates an OAuth web flow inside a WebView dialog rather than using Android's native Google Play Services.
* **Resolution:**
  * Added `com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:21.3.0` to `android/app/build.gradle.kts`.
  * Built `NativeGoogleAuthPlugin.kt` which invokes the **native Android Google Account Chooser bottom sheet** via Google Play Services `GoogleSignInClient`.
  * Users tap their device's already-logged-in Gmail account with **one tap** (no password prompt, no web popup).
  * The plugin securely returns the Google ID Token, which `authHelper.ts` exchanges for a Firebase Auth credential using `signInWithCredential(auth, credential)`.
  * On desktop/web browsers, `authHelper.ts` smoothly falls back to standard web popup authentication.

### 4. Cache Memory Resumption for Left-in-Half Articles
* **Feature:**
  * When a user starts reading an article and exits before finishing, their scroll progress is automatically saved to local cache memory (`localStorage`).
  * When they reopen the article or view the Home feed, a "Resume Reading" banner allows them to jump right back to where they left off.
* **Implementation:**
  * `src/utils/readingProgress.ts`: Tracks scroll progress, title, category, and timestamp.
  * `PostDetailView.tsx`: Monitors scroll depth, displays the "Resume Reading" prompt if progress is between 5% and 92%.
  * `HomeView.tsx`: Displays the "Continue Reading" shelf for in-progress articles.

### 5. Native Android Framework Update (Capacitor Native vs. Webview Wrapper)
* **Improvements:**
  * Standardized `capacitor.config.ts` and `capacitor.config.json` to load bundled local assets from `webDir: 'dist'` natively.
  * Removed the `webView.webChromeClient` override in `MainActivity.kt` that was breaking Capacitor's native bridge.
  * Compiled and synced all assets into `android/app/src/main/assets/public` using `npm run cap:build` (`npx cap sync android`).

### 6. Google AdSense Review Approval & Policy Compliance
* **Symptoms:**
  * Site failed Google AdSense review with two policy rejection notices:
    1. *"Google-served ads on screens without publisher-content (We do not allow Google-served ads on screens without content or with low value content, that are under construction, that are used for alerts, navigation or other behavioral purposes)."*
    2. *"Low value content (Site must provide authentic, high-quality information, exhibit ongoing curation, and sustain genuine user interest)."*
* **Root Causes:**
  1. **Global Auto-Ads on Utility/Empty Screens:** The global AdSense script in `<head>` was attempting to inject automated ads into administrative screens (`/admin`), login/profile hubs (`/profile`), settings toggles (`/settings`), empty bookmarks (`/liked`), and account deletion forms (`/delete-account`).
  2. **Blank Static HTML for AdSense Crawlers:** Being a single-page app (SPA), the server initially returned an empty `<div id="root"></div>`. When `Mediapartners-Google` (the AdSense review bot) fetched pages, it saw zero words of content alongside the AdSense tag.
  3. **Misconfigured Sitemap:** `sitemap.xml` included the utility route `/delete-account`, directing review crawlers directly to a form with zero editorial content.
  4. **Missing Core E-E-A-T Trust Pages:** The publication lacked dedicated "About Us", "Editorial & Fact-Checking Policy", and "Newsroom Contact" pages required by Google Quality Guidelines.
  5. **Footer Isolation:** The footer and legal navigation links were hidden on article pages (`/post/*`), preventing readers and reviewers from accessing policies from articles.
  6. **Missing AdSense Disclosures:** Privacy policy lacked explicit DoubleClick DART cookie clauses and opt-out links.
* **Resolution:**
  1. **Dynamic AdSense Route Guard (`useAdSenseRouteGuard.ts`):** Restricts AdSense script execution strictly to verified editorial publisher screens (`/`, `/post/*`, `/about`, `/editorial-policy`). Injects `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />` on utility pages (`/admin`, `/profile`, `/settings`, `/liked`, `/delete-account`) to completely exclude them from ad evaluation.
  2. **Auto-Ads Ablation Protection (`adsbygoogle-noablate`):** Added the standard `adsbygoogle-noablate` class to the Header, Footer, NewsletterPopup, NotificationBanner, and ConsentBanner to strictly prohibit Google Auto-Ads from inserting ads into navigation, alerts, or modals.
  3. **Core Publisher Trust & Transparency Pages:**
     * `/about` (`AboutView.tsx`): Detailed newsroom mission, journalistic charter, masthead & desk editors, and commercial independence firewall.
     * `/editorial-policy` (`EditorialPolicyView.tsx`): Sourcing protocols (two-source rule, primary documents), fact-checking workflows, transparent corrections and retractions timeline, and human curation & AI oversight policy.
     * `/contact` (`ContactView.tsx`): Newsroom contact directory, tips hotline, corrections desk email, and interactive inquiry form.
  4. **Server-Side Pre-Rendering for AdSense Crawlers (`socialPreview.ts`):** Enabled comprehensive server-side pre-rendering for `Mediapartners-Google`, `Googlebot`, and search spiders:
     * Full article headlines, author bylines, categories, publication dates, and complete body text rendered directly into `<div id="root">`.
     * Automated Schema.org `NewsArticle` JSON-LD structured data.
     * Server pre-rendering for `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, and `/editorial-policy`.
  5. **Semantic Fallback Content in `index.html`:** Provided authentic, structured publisher content inside `<div id="root">` so raw HTML requests always contain substantial news content.
  6. **Compliant Ad Placement Units (`AdSpace.tsx`):**
     * Balanced in-article and in-feed ad units placed with standard dimensions and clear `"ADVERTISEMENT"` labels.
     * Suppressed automatically if content is too short or during loading/error states.
  7. **Clean Sitemap & Robots.txt:**
     * `sitemap.xml`: Removed `/delete-account`; added `/about`, `/editorial-policy`, `/contact`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, and article permalinks.
     * `robots.txt`: Added explicit disallow directives for `Mediapartners-Google` and all bots on `/admin`, `/profile`, `/settings`, `/liked`, and `/delete-account`.
  8. **Global Legal Footer (`Footer.tsx`):** Unlocked footer navigation across all public reader screens with structured columns for Newsroom, Policy, Compliance, and Publisher Credentials.

### 7. Uncaught RangeError: Invalid time value
* **Symptoms:**
  * Application crashed or logged `Uncaught RangeError: Invalid time value` in console when reading or rendering article views, post cards, or liked dispatches.
* **Root Cause:**
  * When Firestore articles are cached in `localStorage` via `JSON.stringify()`, or retrieved via Firestore REST APIs, `createdAt` / `updatedAt` timestamps lose the prototype method `.toDate()` and become raw objects `{ seconds: number, nanoseconds: number }` or numeric strings.
  * Direct invocation of `new Date(post.createdAt)` when `post.createdAt` is an object evaluates to `new Date("[object Object]")`, resulting in an `Invalid Date` object.
  * Calling `.toISOString()` or `.toLocaleDateString()` on an `Invalid Date` throws a native JavaScript `RangeError: Invalid time value`.
* **Resolution:**
  * Created `src/utils/dateHelper.ts` with bulletproof safe utilities:
    * `safeParseDate(rawDate)`: Handles JS `Date`, Firestore `Timestamp` with `.toDate()`, serialized `{ seconds, nanoseconds }` / `{ _seconds }`, REST `{ timestampValue }`, unix millisecond/second numbers, and date strings. Returns a valid `Date` or `null`.
    * `safeFormatDate(rawDate, options, fallback)`: Safely formats any date without throwing errors, gracefully falling back to a default label (e.g. `'Recent Post'`).
    * `safeToIsoString(rawDate, fallback)`: Safely outputs an ISO 8601 string without throwing `RangeError`.
  * Removed redundant schema injection in `PostDetailView.tsx` that invoked raw `.toISOString()` without date validation.
  * Replaced direct `d.toLocaleDateString()` calls with `safeFormatDate` across `PostDetailView.tsx`, `BlogPostCard.tsx`, `LikedView.tsx`, `AdminView.tsx`, and `socialPreview.ts`.
